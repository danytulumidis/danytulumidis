### Hi there! Im Dany and i love coding 👋
<p align="center">Im a Full Stack Web Developer focusing on the frontend at the moment. In my day job im working mostly with Angular and Typescript. In the past i worked as an Cloud Consultant and gathered a lot of knowledge within AWS. I love to learn new things every single day and try to improve myself from day to day. There is no better feeling but to crack the problem you faced for hours or even days. I love it!
When i need a break from coding i love to read blog posts in the tech field to stay up to date. Im also a gamer and love to play videogames.</p>
